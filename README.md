# One Page Responsive Website

I am re-creating the Conquer Free CSS Template (http://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page196/conquer). This site will form part of my portfolio for Front End Web Development.

I am creating this site without using the Conquer Template itself. I will not look at the underlying code of the Template. Nor will I use the Bootstrap framework that the Conquer Template is based on.
